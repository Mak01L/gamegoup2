# Like/Dislike System - GameGoUp!

## Description
A Tinder-style matching system has been implemented instead of the traditional "Add Friend" system. Users can now evaluate other users with "Like" or "Dislike" to create more organic connections.

## Implemented Features

### 1. New "Discover" Tab
- Replaces the "Add Friend" tab
- Shows users one by one for evaluation
- Card-style interface with avatar and username

### 2. Like/Dislike System
- **ðŸ’– Like**: Indicates interest in the user
- **ðŸ‘Ž Dislike**: Moves to next user without creating connection
- Evaluated users don't appear again

### 3. Match Detection
- When two users mutually "Like" each other, a **Match** is created
- Matches automatically become friendships
- Visual notification when a match occurs: "ðŸŽ‰ It's a Match with [username]!"

### 4. Smart Filters
- Doesn't show already evaluated users
- Doesn't show users who are already friends
- Doesn't show the user's own profile

## Database Structure

### New Table: `likes_dislikes`
```sql
CREATE TABLE likes_dislikes (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    target_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    action TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (action IN ('like', 'dislike')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, target_user_id)
);
```

### Matches View: `matches_view`
View that automatically identifies mutual matches:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW matches_view AS
SELECT DISTINCT
    CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l1.user_id ELSE l2.user_id END as user1_id,
    CASE WHEN l1.user_id < l2.user_id THEN l2.user_id ELSE l1.user_id END as user2_id,
    GREATEST(l1.created_at, l2.created_at) as matched_at
FROM likes_dislikes l1
JOIN likes_dislikes l2 ON (
    l1.user_id = l2.target_user_id 
    AND l1.target_user_id = l2.user_id
    AND l1.action = 'like' 
    AND l2.action = 'like'
)
WHERE l1.user_id != l2.user_id;
```

## User Flow

1. **Access the System**: User enters Friends & Messages â†’ "âœ¨ Discover" Tab
2. **Evaluate Users**: A card with a user is presented
3. **Make Decision**: 
   - Click "ðŸ’– Like" if interested
   - Click "ðŸ‘Ž Dislike" to move to next user
4. **Automatic Match**: If there's reciprocity, match is notified and friendship is created
5. **Continue**: System automatically advances to next user

## Application States

### Initial State
- Loads all users available for evaluation
- Filters already evaluated users and existing friends
- Shows counter: "User X of Y"

### Evaluation State
- Buttons disabled while processing action
- Visual feedback during loading
- Confirmation messages

### Final State
- "You've seen everyone!" when no more users available
- "ðŸ”„ Refresh List" button to reload

## Advantages of the New System

1. **More Natural**: Simulates popular dating apps
2. **Less Invasive**: No pending friend requests
3. **Automatic**: Matches instantly become friendships
4. **Efficient**: Avoids manual request management
5. **Gamified**: More entertaining than a simple directory

## Modified Files

- `src/components/MessagingSystem.tsx`: Main system logic
- `likes_dislikes_schema.sql`: Database schema
- New TypeScript interfaces for `UserToRate`

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Implement geolocation system for proximity-based matches
2. Add filters by age, interests, favorite games
3. Implement "Super Likes" as premium feature
4. Add transition animations between users
5. Reporting system for inappropriate users
